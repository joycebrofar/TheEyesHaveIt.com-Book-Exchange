# Identifying User Stories and Use Cases (TheEyesHaveIt.com Book Exchange)

**TheEyesHaveIt.com** Book Exchange is a type of e-business exchange that does business entirely on the
Internet. The company acts as a clearinghouse for buyers and sellers of used books.


To offer books for sale, a person must register with TheEyesHaveIt.com. The person must provide a current
physical address and telephone number as well as a current e-mail address. Next, the system then maintains
an open account for this person. Access to the system as a seller is through a secure, authenticated portal.


A seller can list books in the system through a special Internet form. The form asks for all the pertinent
information about the book, its category, its general condition, and the asking price. A seller may list as many
books as desired. The system maintains an index of all books in the system so buyers can use the search
engine to search for books. The search engine allows searches by title, author, category, and keyword.
People who want to buy books come to the site and search for the books they want. When they decide to
buy, they must open an account with a credit card to pay for the books. The system maintains all this
information on secure servers.


When a purchase is made, TheEyesHaveIt.com sends an e-mail notice to the chosen book’s seller and
payment information. It also marks the book as sold. The system maintains an open order until it receives
notice that the book has been shipped. After the seller receives notice that a listed book has been sold, the
seller must notify the buyer via e-mail within 48 hours that the purchase is noted. The shipment of the order
must be made within 24 hours after the seller sends the notification e-mail. The seller sends a notification to
the buyer and TheEiyesHaveIt.com when the shipment is made.


After receiving the notice shipment, TheEyesHaveIt.com maintains the order in shipped status. Every month,
a check is mailed to each seller for the book orders that have remained in a shipped status for 30 days. The
30-day waiting period exists to allow the buyer to notify TheEyeHaveIt.com I the shipment doesn’t arrive for
some reason or if the book isn’t in the same condition as advertised.
If they want, buyers can enter a service code for the seller. The service code is an indication of how well the
seller is servicing book purchases. Some sellers are very active and use TheEyesHaveIt.com as a major
outlet for selling books. Thus, a service code is an important indicator of potential buyers.
